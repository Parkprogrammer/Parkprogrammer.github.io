## Research Interests

Machine Learning, dealing with manifolds and optimization for models in industrial or 
medical domains such as continuous data and tabular data, understanding model outputs for 
generalization. Convex optimization and solving generalization problems (grokking) through 
mathematical methods such as Taylor series, Fourier or Laplace transformation. Finding the learning 
mechanism behind memorization and understanding the mechanisms of Neural Fields.
