## Beginning My AI Research Journey

My Works on Deep Neural Networks, Machine Learning will be posted in korean. But i am hoping to create much impact on the AI research.

So i will try my best to keep things updated in english as well.

Main interests lie in mechanistic-interpretation, State-Space-Modeling, Neural-Tangent-Kernel and Generalization, transductive-learning.

Any suggestions or arguments are always welcomed.
Thank you!
