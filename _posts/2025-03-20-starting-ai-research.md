## Beginning My AI Research Journey

I'm excited to share that I've recently begun a new chapter in my career as an AI Researcher at The Catholic University of Korea St. Vincent's Hospital. This role marks a significant milestone in my journey into the field of healthcare AI, allowing me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world medical challenges.

## The Healthcare AI Landscape

Healthcare AI is one of the most promising and impactful applications of machine learning technologies. The ability to process vast amounts of medical data, identify patterns, and support clinical decision-making has the potential to transform patient care and outcomes.

Some of the key areas I'm focusing on include:

- **Medical data preprocessing**: Working with complex, heterogeneous data sources
- **Feature engineering**: Converting raw medical data into meaningful features
- **Imbalanced learning**: Addressing the inherent imbalance in medical datasets
- **Interpretable AI**: Ensuring model outputs can be understood by healthcare professionals

## Current Projects

### Patient Data Analysis

One of my primary projects involves analyzing patient data to identify risk factors for specific conditions. This requires handling:

- Missing values using K-NN imputers
- High-dimensional data visualization with t-SNE
- Categorical feature encoding with vector embedding techniques
- Model training with specialized XGBoost variants for imbalanced data

### Challenges in Medical ML

Working with healthcare data presents unique challenges:

1. **Data quality**: Medical data often contains missing values, errors, and inconsistencies
2. **Privacy concerns**: Ensuring patient confidentiality while working with sensitive information
3. **Interpretability**: The critical need for models that doctors can understand and trust
4. **Class imbalance**: Many medical conditions are rare, leading to severely imbalanced datasets

## Learning and Growth

This experience has already provided valuable insights into the practical applications of machine learning in a clinical setting. The gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation is significant, and bridging this gap requires:

- Collaboration with medical professionals
- Understanding of domain-specific challenges
- Adaptability in approach and methodology
- Continuous learning and experimentation

## Future Directions

As I continue this journey, I plan to explore:

- Integration of large language models for medical text analysis
- Development of more robust feature engineering techniques
- Research into better evaluation metrics for clinical AI systems
- Publication of findings and methodologies to contribute to the field

I look forward to sharing more updates and insights as this research progresses. If you're working in healthcare AI or interested in collaboration, please feel free to reach out!
